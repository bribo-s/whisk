Whisk is the very first application that I have built on Xcode! Essentially, it serves as a chatbot that reassuringly communicates with users during late-night commutes! 

I designed and developed the app using Xcode, Swift, and chatbot technology to enhance user safety during late-night commutes. The app allows users to contact emergency services, provides support and comfort, and offers a range of additional features, including the ability to ask the chatbot questions. My motivation for creating this app stems from a personal experience where an acquaintance went missing and was later found to have been attacked while commuting home late at night. My goal is to ensure that everyone can feel secure when travelling at any time, day or night.

Thank you for reading!
